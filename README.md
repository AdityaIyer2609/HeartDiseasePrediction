# HeatDiseasePrediction
In this project I have predicted whether a person has a heart disease or not. I have taken the dataset from UC Irvine repository. This dataset has fourteen attributes. They are, age, sex, chest pain type (4 values), resting blood pressure, serum cholestoral in mg/dl, fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl, resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2), maximum heart rate achieved, exercise induced angina, oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest, the slope of the peak exercise ST segment, number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy, thal: 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect and the Target (0- No disease, 1- has Disease). I have used Logistic Regression to solve this problem. Basically Logistic Regression uses Stochastic Gradient Descent, in other words the Sigmoind Function. In this model I trained a dataset of 303 rows and 14 columns. I have split the dataet in ratio of 90:10(training data : test data). This model achieved the train data accuracy of 84.1% and Test data accuracy of 83.8%, which shows that there is not overfitting of the data.
